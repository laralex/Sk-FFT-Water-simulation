The application is developed in Rust programming language, to launch it you'd need to have
[`cargo` tool installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) on your PC, then `cargo build && cargo run" should successfully build
the application, its dependancies, and show up a graphical window with the demo
